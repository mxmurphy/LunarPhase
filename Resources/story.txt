This is a text based adventure where you lost the company spaceship. Your
company, MEMCorp, operates on the Moon, Earth, and Mars. Even though you've
been working there for a decade, you aren't quite sure what the company does.
As far as you can tell, MEMCorp investigates mundane details of other corporations,
things like whether the majority of the client's employees wear white or black socks.
Nothing that actually requires a spaceship--but your boss will be very angry when
she notices it is gone. In order to not lose your job you need to find it before she
realizes it is lost! Will you take on the challenge of not getting fired?

Welcome to the game.

You have hitched a ride on the commuter shuttle and are en route to the moon.
You look around at the sea of depressed faces and are immediately thankful
that you don't need to make this daily commute. You arrive at the moon and
immediately make your way to the MOON BASE.

You look around the economy class spaceship and notice the passengers are
far less depressed--probably due to the increased legroom. You are even happier
because you got an exit row with even more legroom(though you do wonder why
they still have this relic of earthbound airplanes--considering you cannot
open the door without killing everyone inside.) Once you land on Mars, you
quickly make your way to the MARS BASE.

After you realize the spaceship AI has turned evil, you spend the next few
hours desperately trying to convince the ship to allow you to fly it back to
Earth. Eventually it relents after you agree to go on a date with it. Which,
yet again, confuses you to no end. But you make the promise with absolutely
no intention of following through--it's not immoral to ghost a computer, right?
Once you arrive back at the MEMCorp Earth office, you park the spaceship in it's
normal parking spot, and see your manager sternly walking towards you...
